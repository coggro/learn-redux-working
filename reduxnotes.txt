01 - Setting Up Our Webpack Environment.mp4
    Need:
        NodeJS
        React Dev Tools
        Redux Dev Tools
        Terminal (iTerm2)
        npm install
    Download source repo and run npm i

02 - App Layout + Component Setup.mp4
    client folder contains app, starting in reduxtagram.js
    Styles folder contains all styles in stylus
    reduxtagram.js
        import React from "react";

        import { render } from "react-dom";

        // Import css
        import css from "./styles/style.styl";

        render(<p>Hi</p>, document.getElementById("root"));
    Create other components
        main
            Inside of that, chooses if it shows photo grid or single
        Each component lives in its own JS file in the components directory
        client/components/Main.js
            import React from "react";
            import { Link } from "react-router"; // make router links

            class Main extends React.Component {
                render() {
                    return (
                        <div>
                            <h1>
                                <Link to="/">Reduxtagram</Link>
                            </h1>
                        </div>
                    );
                }
            }

            export default Main;
        client/reduxtagram.js
            ...
            // Import Components
            import Main from "./components/Main";
            ...
            render(<Main />, document.getElementById("root"));

03 - Creating our Single and PhotoGrid components.mp4
    client/components/Single.js
        // Paste in main, pretty much the same setup
        import React from "react";

        class Single extends React.Component {
            render() {
                return <div className="single-photo" />;
            }
        }

        export default Single;
    client/components/PhotoGrid.js
        import React from "react";

        class PhotoGrid extends React.Component {
            render() {
                return <div className="photo-grid">I'm the photo grid</div>;
            }
        }

        export default PhotoGrid;
    Routing
        Actual switching out will be handled by react router, usually {this.props.children} ==> handled by react-router, but can't hand down props in that way
        Going to use {React.cloneElement(this.props.children, this.props)} in Main.js under h1
        Doesn't work without children
        Set up router, which will pass it children

04 - Setting up React Router.mp4
    client/reduxtagram.js
        ...
        // Import Components
        import Main from "./components/Main";
        import Single from "./components/Single"; // import other components
        import PhotoGrid from "./components/PhotoGrid";

        // import react router dependencies
        import { Router, Route, IndexRoute, browserHistory } from "react-router";

        const router = ( // build router with children
            <Router history={browserHistory}>
                <Route path="/" component={Main}> // import main at root
                    <IndexRoute component={PhotoGrid} /> // PhotoGrid when index
                    <Route path="/view/:postId" component={Single} /> // Single when
                </Route>
            </Router>
        );

        render(router, document.getElementById("root"));

05 - Creating our Redux Store.mp4
    First video to talk about Redux instead of just React
    All data for our app is in a store, rather than a state
    Not many components with many states, just one object with store.
    client/store.js
        import { createStore, compose } from "redux";
        import { syncHistoryWithStore } from "react-router-redux";
        import { browserHistory } from "react-router";

        // import the root reducer
        // will look at actions, what they do, and reducers
        import rootReducer from "./reducers/index";

        // sample data
        import comments from "./data/comments";
        import posts from "./data/posts";

        // Create an object for the default data.
        const defaultState = {
            posts,
            comments
        };

        // Create the store
        const store = createStore(rootReducer, defaultState);

        // Export history, then default export store
        export const history = syncHistoryWithStore(browserHistory, store);

        export default store;

06 - All About Redux Actions.mp4
    All about actions and action creators
    Action is something that happens in your app - click on a photo, likes a page, leaves a comment, etc.
    Whenever something happens, it dispatches an action, with 2 pieces of info
        1) Name of the action
        2) Payload of data required to execute action
    Reducers go in the opposite reaction - once you add the action, how do we actually update the data and let React handle the changes?
    client/actions/actionCreators.js
        // can be separate files, but don't have to be
        // incremement likes
        function increment(index) {
            return {
                type: "INCREMENT_LIKES",
                index
            };
        }

        // add comment
        function addComment(postId, author, comment) {
            return {
                type: "ADD_COMMENT",
                postID,
                author,
                comment
            };
        }

        // remove comment
        function removeComment(postId, i) {
            return {
                type: "REMOVE_COMMENT",
                i,
                postId
            };
        }
        // How do we do anything with that data when the action is dispatched?
        // With reducers.

07 - All About Redux Reducers.mp4
    Need to use reducers to actually update the state
    In browser, we can listen for events like click and hover
    We create reducers to listen for our action events - for every piece of state (posts, comments)
    client/reducers/posts.js
        function posts(state = [], action) {
            console.log(state, action);
            return state;
        }

        export default posts;
    client/reducers/comments.js
        function comments(state = [], action) {
            console.log(state, action);
            return state;
        }

        export default comments;
    client/reducers/index.js
        // this is the big daddy reducer

        import { combineReducers } from "redux";
        import { routerReducer } from "react-router-redux";

        import posts from "./posts";
        import comments from "./comments";

        const rootReducer = combineReducers({ posts, comments, router: routerReducer });

        export default rootReducer;

08 - Integrating our Store with React Router.mp4
    client/reduxtagram.js
        ...
        import { Provider } from 'react-redux'; // bindings allow us to use redux with react
        import store, { history } from './store';
        // This should allow you to see the state in the console log
        const router = (
            <Provider store={store}> // wrap entire router in provider
                <Router history={history}> // use history from store
                    <Route path="/" component={Main}>
                        <IndexRoute component={PhotoGrid} />
                        <Route path="/view/:postId" component={Single} />
                    </Route>
                </Router>
            </Provider>
        );

09 - Understanding The Reducer's Job and Dispatching Actions.mp4
    Go to react dev tools, select provider
    Go to console, run $r.store.dispatch({type: 'INCREMENT_LIKES', index: 0});
    See that posts and comments actions both ran
    Turns out Redux runs all actions, it's up to the reducer to decide if it executes
    That's where we're going to write a switch to handle all action types

10 - Accessing Dispatch and State with Redux.mp4
    How do we get our state to go into Main?
        Regular React passes it down every single level through props
        Redux lets us use connect, which allows us to inject that data at whatever level we actually need it
        Going to connect data to component we need and make the action creators.
        Can add infuse presentational component with action creators and data by kind of sprinkling another component on top.
